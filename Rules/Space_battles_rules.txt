Rules of Space Battles:

You can choose between two gamemodes - multiplayer and singleplayer

In singleplayer mode, 
use 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys on your keyboard to move up, left, down and right respectively

use the spacebar to shoot bullets

In multiplayer mode, 
for player 1, use 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' and left shift to move and shoot
for player 2, use the up, down, left, right arrow keys and the right shift to move and shoot

In both modes you must dodge the bullets of the opposing spaceship and try to hit the enemy

In multiplayer mode you both have 10 health points and must dodge the bullets to stay alive
the first one to lose all 10 health points loses the gamemodes

In singleplayer mode you have 10 health points and must score as many hits against the ai as you can
shooting and hitting the ai once gives you one point and you must try to get a highscore before losing all of your health

Have Fun!
